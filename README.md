# Zebra - a CSS grid system without the fluff
This is a grid system at it's rawest. Zebra simply provides you with a number of premade CSS classes which you can use to quickly add basic structure to a website.

Whilst most modern grid systems are implementing more and more advanced features, Zebra is taking a more stripped back approach. You won't find set column gutters or margins, and there are only a few column sizes that have responsive behaviour built in by default.

## What is Zebra?
Based on the BEM methodology

Whilst websites from the early days of the web were often restricted to using a 960px grid and tables, current technology allows designers and developers infinitely more freedom when it comes to structuring a page.

This results in designs that no longer follow a set grid, with elements often containing their own grid

Just like a Zebra's stripes, every website is unique.
