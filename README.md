# Zebra - a CSS grid system without the fluff
Just like a Zebra's stripes, every website design is unique.
Whilst websites from the early days of the web were often constructed using a 960px grid and tables, current technology allows designers and developers infinitely more freedom when it comes to structuring content.
This means that a page may have to be split into 24+ columns just to keep elements aligned properly, which is a tad excessive.

We therefore believe that a grid system should be as flexible as possible, to allow a developer to change .


Whilst most modern CSS grid systems are getting more and more complex, with guttering, margins and prebuilt responsive classes, Zebra is pushing in the opposite direction.



We have stripped back a lot of features that most modern frameworks come with, resulting in a grid system at it's rawest.
There are no complex margins and gutters, no responsive classes, no

It offers a number of pre-made CSS classes that you can add to your elements, instantly adding rows and columns, without all the fluff of a modern grid system.
